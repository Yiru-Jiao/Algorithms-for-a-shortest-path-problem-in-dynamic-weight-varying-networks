# Algorithms-for-a-shortest-path-problem-in-dynamic-weight-varying-networks
These codes were for  a study of "A novel model and its algorithms for the shortest path problem of dynamic weight-varying networks in Intelligent Transportation Systems" that is published in "Journal of Intelligent &amp; Fuzzy Systems", 2017, volume 33(5): 3095-3102.

to repeat the expirement, execute code below in Matlab (at first ensure all .m files and .mat files are in the same folder)
The improved adaptive ant colony algorithm: VWA(D,V,C,delta_t0,1,6,10,5,2,0.5,0.5,0.8)
The brute-force algorithm based on matrix expansion: VWN(D,V,C,delta_t0,1,6)

I'm so sorry I could not remember and provide more details for the project ran nearly 3 years ago.
